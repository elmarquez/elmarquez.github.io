      <section>
        <article><p>In 1998, the International Foundation for the Canadian Centre for Architecture
(IFCCA) held an ideas competition called the <em>Competition for the Design
of Cities</em>. The challenge of the competition was to create a speculative design
for a sixteen block area of Manhattan (Figure 1). The IFCCA
invited a coterie of internationally recognized architects to participate.
Among that group was the team of Morphosis Architects and George Yu.</p>
<p><img src="./20070417-ifcca/MAYNE-IFCCA-SC-15.png" alt="IFCCA Competition Site, New York City.  The site is bounded on the west by the Hudson River, east by 8th Avenue, north by 30th Street, and south by 34th Street."></p>
<p>Morphosis Architects is an internationally recognized architectural design firm.
Its principle, Thom Mayne, is a winner of the Pritzker Prize in architecture, a
founding member of the Southern California Institute of Architecture and a
studio instructor at the UCLA School of Architecture.  George Yu is the principle of
George Yu Architects, formerly Design Office.  He is a recipient of the
Canadian Rome Prize, a former project architect with Morphosis Architects, and
studio instructor at the Southern California Institute of Architecture.</p>
<p>The Morphosis/Yu team immediately recognized the challenge presented by
the enormous site.  Designing and managing the development of 16 city
blocks of dense urban space would require perhaps more than ten years of work.<br>
Within that period, the project would pass through numerous political, social
and economic cycles, and the very context upon which the design would be
predicated in 1998 would change significantly before its completion. A norm of
architectural design is that a project should be integrated in its site.
Achieving that degree of integration in a changing context necessitated an
approach that would enable both adaptation of the design to change and
engagement of the complex and particular conditions of the site.
<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> The history of cities provided inspiration for a novel
approach to the challenges of the design process:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The traditional city depended on the stability of its economic and productive structure, a relative uniformity of social composition and the concentrated  political power of oligarchies.  These conditions were translated into a stable,  homogeneous, hierarchic spatial organization.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It is increasingly difficult to experience the city as a linear process or to operate by limiting variation to reinforce a given geometrical structure. It is precisely the instability of the regimes of flexible economic accumulation and the increasing pace of change that bring the variable conditions of new urban structures to the forefront, putting into question traditional city building strategies.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Therefore: a dynamic process with multi-scenario responses (no fixed solutions) to varied forces, the site is to be organized by a set of independent components influenced by formal mutations arising from their interaction, &hellip;, the emerging urban construct is no longer linked to a singular city typology, but a composite of historical and emerging city typologies, simultaneously Cairo, Tokyo, the medieval village, New York City, and Los Angeles, and the new next city. <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="ifcca-design-process">IFCCA Design Process</h2>
<p>The Morphosis/Yu IFCCA design approach was organized around three conceptual
elements: 1) Independent Components, 2) interactions that created formal
mutations of these Independent Components, and 3) multi-scenario responses.<br>
Independent Components were geometric objects suggestive of an architectural
use or intent.  Mayne and Yu
characterize these components as <em>morphological characters</em>.<br>
Coupled with each Independent Component was a notion of how the element might
be inhabited, how it would transform as a consequence of an interaction with
other Components, and the kinds of conditions the element would &ldquo;seek&rdquo;.<br>
Independent Components were named so as to capture these traits.  For example,
&ldquo;Noodles&rdquo; were proportionately long, slender elements that would bend and move
between other elements as required to accommodate particular conditions.<br>
&ldquo;Linkers&rdquo; were long, thin and relatively small elements that would criss cross
between other elements, creating interconnections.  Other Components included
Warp, Snake, Conquistador, Missle, Bar, Pug, Floater, Bit, Passage, Pod, Hold,
and Display (Table ?).</p>
<p><img src="./20070417/MAYNE-IFCCA-SC-15.png" alt="&lsquo;Floater&rsquo; Independent Component. The Floater is a water structure that plays the role of an artificial beach. (1998)Courtesy Morphosis Architects/George Yu."></p>
<h3 id="independent-components">Independent Components</h3>
<p>Designs were created by bringing Independent Components together in a site
model, having them interact with one another, and then organizing their
interactions into or around scenarios.  Following rules specified in advance,
Designers would place Components in the site model then adjust and integrate
them into their local conditions.  Figure ?
illustrates a group of Noodles interacting with one another and elements of the
site model.  Linkers are deployed to cross connect Noodles where opportunities
exist.  Independent Components change shape and configuration &ndash; what the
architects termed <em>formal mutations</em> &ndash; as a result of these interactions.  The
aggregate configuration of these components was the design.  Designers could
change the mixture of Components to achieve different design objectives.</p>
<h3 id="scenario">Scenario</h3>
<p>Scenarios guided the interactions of Components, and the development of
designs.  The concept of scenario as employed in the IFCCA project is related
to the concept of <em>version</em>.  However, where a version simply makes the
distinction that some artifact is different from and related to another
artifact, scenarios capture the contingent relation between the context of
design and the artifacts that arise in response.  In so far as they are
<em>interpretations</em> of a context as it exists, or speculations about how a
context may develop in the future, scenarios can be said to bind the subjective
state of the Designer with the resultant design.  Scenarios organize design
activity into focused explorations, often centered around design narratives and
key factors.  Narratives are heuristic devices employed by Designers to guide
the development of design activity over time.  For example, a Designer may
devise a scenario around the notion of &ldquo;growth&rdquo; of an element over time.  The
design that follows would then employ this notion to guide design work, and
emphasize those characteristics that make growth behavior apparent in the
design. Factors are properties that give a scenario <em>identity</em>.</p>

<p>George Yu [YU2006] explains that the starting point for the IFCCA design
was the need for a public park in Manhattan.  The design team decided early on
to situate the park on an elevated plinth.  Subsequently, each design scenario
took the plinth as its starting point.  Three major design scenarios,
identified as scenarios 33, 15 and 28, were developed.  Each scenario explored
design possibilities based on different levels of investment in building cost,
floor area ratio, total daytime population, and total floor area for the
development.  Scenario 28 (Figure \ref{img:scenario28}) had the highest total
floor area, followed by 15 (Figure \ref{img:scenario15}) and then 33
(Figure \ref{img:scenario33}).  In scenarios 28 and 15, a large cluster of
Noodles occupy the south edge of the site adjacent to the Chelsea district.
The existing Madison Square Gardens building is replaced with a high density
tower Component called a Conquistador, and then a new sports facility is
designed in a site further west.  The waterfront in both of these scenarios
is occupied by recreational buildings and artificial beaches.  Scenario 33,
increases the open park area over scenarios 15 and 28, and the high density
cluster of Noodle components is moved farther East.</p>
<p>Yu recalls that one of the original motivations for taking on the project was
to experiment with new parametric modeling software.  At the time,
Alias/Wavefront had just released the first version of Maya, which offered a
scriptable modeling environment that could potentially be used to prototype a
parametric approach.  However, as Yu explains, learning to use Maya while
executing the project proved to be too difficult.  The early conceptual work of
the project was initiated in physical models.  Following initial physical
studies, the remaining design work was produced using form-Z.  Given that form-Z
had no scripting support, the team could only suggest through imagery their
design intent.  As such, they produced a series of Flash animations that were
used to communicate the idea of parametric exploration by showing the
transformation of the designs based on changes to the four primary factors.</p>

<h2 id="strategies-for-adapting-to-change">Strategies for Adapting to Change</h2>
<p>The effect of the Morphosis/Yu approach was to render the design as
<em>a system of interacting parts</em>. Independent Components were morphological
types defined through geometric properties and relations.  Components then
interacted with other Components in the site, leading to formal mutations and an
increasing specificity of the Components to their local conditions.  Interactions
between Components were guided and organized into scenarios that could be
presented as contingent designs.  This approach supported change and
responsiveness to the conditions of the site in a number of ways.</p>
<p>Independent Components were systemic objects with geometric organization and
identity. Noodles for example, were proportionately long and slender.  When a
Designer modified an instance of a Noodle, they would stretch and bend it in
the CAD model, understanding that it should remain identifiable as a long and
slender object.  Second, rules or behaviors associated with the Component
guided and localized its interactions with other Components.  For example,
given that Components were intended as building-like objects, in most
circumstances they would need to maintain minimum clearances from one another
to ensure proper access to light and air.  As such, placing a Component next to
another Component would effectively trigger the setback rule, and prompt the
Designer to modify the Component and adjacent Components to resolve the
condition.  As Independent Components interacted with one another, their
forms became more specific to their local circumstances.  The local focus of
interactions meant that Components could be added and removed from the model
without necessitating redesigns of the whole.  Third, notions of agency
coupled with the Components guided their deployment and interactions in the
model.  When situated in a particular condition, a Component might seek
to improve its state, or respond to changes in the context in some particular
fashion.  The role of the Designer was to execute those responses in light of
the identity of the Component.</p>
<p>Scenarios complemented the exploratory facilities provided by Components by
constraining and focusing design activity, providing guiding narratives,
breaking the design process into chunks, and enabling reflection.  Yu explains
that there were four principal factors underpinning the three design scenarios
&mdash; levels of investment in building cost, floor area ratio, total daytime
population, and total floor area for the whole development.  The multi-scenario
approach organized the exploration of variations on these four specific
factors.  Particular themes emerged in these scenario explorations: low,
medium and high density variations, alternative locations of Madison Square
Gardens, waterfront recreational facilities, and so on.  We might characterize
this emergence of themes as an effective clustering of design variations or
factor values.  Scenario designs and their corresponding design themes evolved
over time.  This evolution could be conceived of in terms of a continuous
process or an incremental movement (ie. in steps) between different
conceptualizations.  Regardless, the scenario provides a discrete unit of
conceptualization or design that can be extended and developed further.  The
multi-scenario approach is also an overt <em>exploratory</em> strategy that
affords increased opportunities for comparison between designs, reflection and
learning.  By representing scenarios in different states and at different
times, the Designer is provided opportunities to learn by considering the
nature of the differences presented, and making connections between Designer
actions and results.</p>
<p>The design approach distinguished different strata or areas of concern
within the overall process and within the design itself.  The development of
Independent Components, for example, was a different concern and a different
process than the management of interactions between Components and the site, or
the development and evaluation of scenarios.  Such a separation of concerns
would not preclude integrated development of these different areas but,
afforded the opportunity to reduce the interdependencies between activities such
that they could be executed asynchronously.  Such a separation of concerns also
allowed Designers to focus on more narrow tasks without having to worry about
their immediate interrelation with the larger process or design.</p>
<p>Finally, taken as a whole, the approach facilitated change and adaptation
through its focus on process rather than on the product of design activity. In
providing Independent Components with identity and rules governing their
interactions with other Components, Designers would not have to rethink their
individual forms when changes occurred.  By organizing designs around the basis
of interactions, the design could be continually changed and modified without
having to think about the design compositionally.  By making explicit the
process for executing interactions, the design could be realized faster and
changes made with less effort.</p>
<h2 id="analysis">Analysis</h2>
<p>The Morphosis/Yu IFCCA project is multi-faceted, and responds to concerns
located both within the competition and within the discipline of architecture
itself. In attempting to understand and describe what we find most compelling
about the work, we have approached it from various perspectives and sought to
situate our discussion and analysis in appropriate theoretical grounds.  Our
readings have led us to three research domains that we contend are relevant to
the work at hand: systems, Designer cognitive behavior, and parametric
modeling.  We have argued that the IFCCA approach renders the design as a
system of interacting parts.  The systems sciences provide us with a general
model of systems and their properties, and specify heuristic methods that
enable their study.  The systems approach to organizational management
suggests strategies for improving the performance and adaptability of systems.</p>
<p>The cognitive sciences provide empirical evidence of the limitations of human
cognitive faculties.  Designer cognitive behaviors develop from those
limitations and, in response, Designers have developed characteristic
strategies for reducing cognitive complexity when dealing with design problems.</p>
<p>The IFCCA approach employs hierarchy and discrete choice throughout the design
process, affording means for reducing the cognitive complexity of design tasks.<br>
Finally, parametric CAD systems enable the modeling of both objects and
relations; in other words, systems.  There is a natural affinity between the
IFCCA approach, which we argue renders the design as a system of interacting
parts, and parametric tools that facilitate the modeling of systems.</p>
<p>In the following sections, we provide high level overviews of each of these
research domains, characterize the properties of the IFCCA approach through
the lens of each of these domains, and then draw from those analyses key
themes and principles to guide the development of our proposed parametric
modeler.  Our analysis will also serve to locate opportunities for further
research.</p>

      <section>
        <article><p>Design is distinguished in many respects from other intellectual endeavors.<br>
Simon explains that, &ldquo;The natural sciences are
concerned with how things are. &hellip; Design, on the other hand, is concerned with
how things ought to be, with devising artifacts to attain goals.&rdquo; <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Designers
interpret design problems and formulate design objectives.  They explore
opportunities and represent possibilities, reflect on prior designs and
communicate design proposals to others.  Designs are <em>contingent</em> upon
the contexts in which they arise. <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> When a designer creates a
design, they do so in light of thier current understanding of what is to be
accomplished and the opportunities available to them at that time.</p>
<p>Contingency presents a twofold challenge to designers.  First, change is a
prominent and growing force in our time.  Peter Drucker argues, &ldquo;No century
in recorded history has experienced so many social transformations and such
radical ones as the twentieth century.&rdquo; <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> Traditional design
approaches focus on the specification of the object to be realized.  When the
context changes, the contingent relations upon which the design are based break
and the design must be revised to regain its persuasiveness. <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>
Because designers are constrained by limitations of resources and time, change
presents a significant impediment to exploration and development of design work
in a traditional approach.  Second, the context of design and the objects of
design themselves are more complex now than ever before.  While
industrialization has significantly expanded our capacity to produce the same
or similar objects millions of times over and with ever increasing economy, it
has not led to a similar increase in our ability to address the complex
conditions of our contemporary world.  Complexity challenges designers to be
cognizant of both the interrelatedness and particularity of phenomena that
characterize design problems.  However, human cognition is limited in its
ability to deal with complexity, and constraints typical to professional
practice impede the exploration and thorough study of contexts that inform
design work.</p>
<p>Understanding and devising means for dealing with change and complexity in
design is a beneficial and timely area of research.  Simon
argues that the challenge of research in design, &ldquo;is to show how empirical
propositions can be made at all about systems that, given different
circumstances, might be quite other than they are.''  The proper means of
studying design, he suggests, is to observe the way in which means are adapted
to environments, &ldquo;and central to that is the process
of design itself.&rdquo; <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup></p>
<p>Our research has benefited greatly in this regard from an exceptional example
of design process.  The Morphosis Architects/George Yu IFCCA competition
project provides a concrete and intelligible model of how change and complexity
can be addressed through design.  Our contention is that the approach
exhibited therein renders the design as <em>a system of interacting parts</em>. The
systemic nature of the process and resulting artifact presents clear
opportunities for description and analysis in terms of systems, accords with
accounts of designer cognitive behavior, and creates apparent opportunities for
computational support.  Drawing on systems models of organizational management,
we hypothesize that the capacity of designers to deal with change and
complexity can be increased by focusing on the management of interactions that
realize the design, rather than on the specification of the design itself.  To
this end, we have conducted exploratory research aimed at the development of a
parametric modeling application intended to facilitate change in design
through the management of interactions.</p>
<p>Our work is presented here in four parts. In Chapter 1, we describe the
Morphosis/Yu project and the properties that make it relevant for
our research.  We situate our observations in the domains of General Systems
Theory, organizational management, Cognitivist research in designer behavior,
parametric modeling, and a class of design support systems known as Design
Space Explorers.  We outline major concepts found in each of these research
areas and discuss their relevance to the issues at hand.  In Chapter 2, we
recast the Morphosis/Yu project as an exemplary research problem in
parametric modeling and describe particular objectives for research in this
area.  We propose a novel propagation-based, parametric modeling application
intended to facilitate change and development in design.  The proposed
application is organized around the interactions of three computational
entities: Assembly, Behavior and Scenario.  Underpinning these entities is a
parallel computing architecture known as the Systolic Array.  We describe how
Behaviors manage interactions and facilitate change in the model over time
through an implicit relational modeling approach that takes the form of the
Dynamic Proxy pattern.  Chapter 3 provides a detailed description of our
implemented system.  We outline in detail the high level organization,
particular concepts and interactions that characterize the system.  We describe
our user interface studies and vectors of inquiry, both past and ongoing, in
the development of the application.  Having developed a demonstrable system, we
presented the system to experts in the domain of architectural design and
parametric modeling.  In Chapter 4, we give an account of our discussions
with these individuals.  They provide an initial evaluation of the
application, our working hypothesis and approach.  We conclude with a summary
of the current status of system development and recommendations for further
research.</p>

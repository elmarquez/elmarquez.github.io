Design, on the other hand, is concerned with\nhow things ought to be, with devising artifacts to attain goals.\" Designers\ninterpret design problems and formulate design objectives.  They explore\nopportunities and represent possibilities, reflect on prior designs and\ncommunicate design proposals to others.  Designs are <em>contingent</em> upon\nthe contexts in which they arise. [AKIN2001]. When a Designer creates a\ndesign, they do so in light of thier current understanding of what is to be\naccomplished and the opportunities available to them at that time.</p>\n<p>Contingency presents a twofold challenge to Designers.  First, change is a\nprominent and growing force in our time.  Peter Drucker argues, \"No century\nin recorded history has experienced so many social transformations and such\nradical ones as the twentieth century.\" [DRUCKER1994] Traditional design\napproaches focus on the specification of the object to be realized.  When the\ncontext changes, the contingent relations upon which the design are based break\nand the design must be revised to regain its persuasiveness. [AKIN2001]<br>\nBecause Designers are constrained by limitations of resources and time, change\npresents a significant impediment to exploration and development of design work\nin a traditional approach.  Second, the context of design and the objects of\ndesign themselves are more complex now than ever before.  While\nindustrialization has significantly expanded our capacity to produce the same\nor similar objects millions of times over and with ever increasing economy, it\nhas not led to a similar increase in our ability to address the complex\nconditions of our contemporary world.  Complexity challenges Designers to be\ncognizant of both the interrelatedness and particularity of phenomena that\ncharacterize design problems.  However, human cognition is limited in its\nability to deal with complexity, and constraints typical to professional\npractice impede the exploration and thorough study of contexts that inform\ndesign work.</p>\n<p>Understanding and devising means for dealing with change and complexity in\ndesign is a beneficial and timely area of research.  Simon<br>\nargues that the challenge of research in design, \"is to show how empirical\npropositions can be made at all about systems that, given different\ncircumstances, might be quite other than they are.''  The proper means of\nstudying design, he suggests, is to observe the way in which means are adapted\nto environments, \"and central to that is the process\nof design itself.'' [p.58]{SIMON1969}.</p>\n<p>Our research has benefited greatly in this regard from an exceptional example\nof design process.  The Morphosis Architects/George Yu IFCCA competition\nproject provides a concrete and intelligible model of how change and complexity\ncan be addressed through design.  Our contention is that the approach\nexhibited therein renders the design as \\textit{a system of interacting parts}.<br>\nThe systemic nature of the process and resulting artifact presents clear\nopportunities for description and analysis in terms of systems, accords with\naccounts of Designer cognitive behavior, and creates apparent opportunities for\ncomputational support.  Drawing on systems models of organizational management,\nwe hypothesize that \\textit{the capacity of Designers to deal with change and\ncomplexity can be increased by focusing on the management of interactions that\nrealize the design, rather than on the specification of the design itself}.  To\nthis end, we have conducted exploratory research aimed at the development of a\nparametric modeling application intended to facilitate change in design\nthrough the management of interactions.</p>\n<p>Our work is presented here in four parts. In Chapter 1, we describe the\nMorphosis/Yu project and the properties that make it relevant for\nour research.  We situate our observations in the domains of General Systems\nTheory, Organizational Management, Cognitivist research in Designer behavior,\nparametric modeling, and a class of design support systems known as Design\nSpace Explorers.  We outline major concepts found in each of these research\nareas and discuss their relevance to the issues at hand.  In Chapter 2, we\nrecast the Morphosis/Yu project as an exemplary research problem in\nparametric modeling and describe particular objectives for research in this\narea.  We propose a novel propagation-based, parametric modeling application\nintended to facilitate change and development in design.  The proposed\napplication is organized around the interactions of three computational\nentities: Assembly, Behavior and Scenario.  Underpinning these entities is a\nparallel computing architecture known as the Systolic Array.  We describe how\nBehaviors manage interactions and facilitate change in the model over time\nthrough an implicit relational modeling approach that takes the form of the\nDynamic Proxy pattern.  Chapter 3 provides a detailed description of our\nimplemented system.  We outline in detail the high level organization,\nparticular concepts and interactions that characterize the system.  We describe\nour user interface studies and vectors of inquiry, both past and ongoing, in\nthe development of the application.  Having developed a demonstrable system, we\npresented the system to experts in the domain of architectural design and\nparametric modeling.  In Chapter 4, we give an account of our discussions\nwith these individuals.  They provide an initial evaluation of the\napplication, our working hypothesis and approach.  We conclude with a summary\nof the current status of system development and recommendations for further\nresearch.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"March 17, 2007","path":"/20070317-research-in-design-exploration","title":"An Inquiry into the Process of Design Exploration"}}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}

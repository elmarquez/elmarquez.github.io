George Yu is the principle of\nGeorge Yu Architects, formerly Design Office.  He is a recipient of the\nCanadian Rome Prize, a former project architect with Morphosis Architects, and\nstudio instructor at the Southern California Institute of Architecture.</p>\n<p>The Morphosis/Yu team immediately recognized the challenge presented by\nthe enormous site.  Designing and managing the development of 16 city\nblocks of dense urban space would require perhaps more than ten years of work.<br>\nWithin that period, the project would pass through numerous political, social\nand economic cycles, and the very context upon which the design would be\npredicated in 1998 would change significantly before its completion. A norm of\narchitectural design is that a project should be integrated in its site.\nAchieving that degree of integration in a changing context necessitated an\napproach that would enable both adaptation of the design to change and\nengagement of the complex and particular conditions of the site.\n\\cite{MAYNE2001ANY}. The history of cities provided inspiration for a novel\napproach to the challenges of the design process:</p>\n<p>\\begin{quotation}\n\"The traditional city depended on the stability of its economic and productive\nstructure, a relative uniformity of social composition and the concentrated\npolitical power of oligarchies.  These conditions were translated into a stable,\nhomogeneous, hierarchic spatial organization.</p>\n<p>It is increasingly difficult to experience the city as a linear process or to\noperate by limiting variation to reinforce a given geometrical structure. It is\nprecisely the instability of the regimes of flexible economic accumulation and\nthe increasing pace of change that bring the variable conditions of new urban\nstructures to the forefront, putting into question traditional city building\nstrategies.</p>\n<p>Therefore: a dynamic process with multi-scenario responses (no fixed solutions)\nto varied forces, the site is to be organized by a set of independent\ncomponents influenced by formal mutations arising from their interaction, ...,\nthe emerging urban construct is no longer linked to a singular city typology,\nbut a composite of historical and emerging city typologies, simultaneously\nCairo, Tokyo, the medieval village, New York City, and Los Angeles, and the new\nnext city.'' \\cite{MAYNEIFCCA1999}.\n\\end{quotation}</p>\n<p>\\subsection{IFCCA Design Process}</p>\n<p>\\index{Independent Component}\nThe Morphosis/Yu IFCCA design approach was organized around three conceptual\nelements: 1) Independent Components, 2) interactions that created <code>formal mutations' of these Independent Components, and 3) multi-scenario responses. Independent Components were geometric objects suggestive of an architectural use or intent. Mayne and Yu (Appendix \\ref{transcript-mayneyu}) characterize these components as</code>morphological characters' or <code>types'. Coupled with each Independent Component was a notion of how the element might be inhabited, how it would transform as a consequence of an interaction with other Components, and the kinds of conditions the element would</code>seek'.<br>\nIndependent Components were named so as to capture these traits.  For example,\n<code>Noodles' were proportionately long, slender elements that would bend and move between other elements as required to accommodate particular conditions.</code>Linkers' were long, thin and relatively small elements that would criss cross\nbetween other elements, creating interconnections.  Other Components included\nWarp, Snake, Conquistador, Missle, Bar, Pug, Floater, Bit, Passage, Pod, Hold,\nand Display (Table \\ref{table:ifccacomponents}).</p>\n<p>%\\begin{figure}[h]\n%\\centering\n%\\includegraphics[width=5.75in,height=1.941in]{files/introduction/ifcca-floaters.png}\n%\\caption{`Floater' Independent Component.

Following rules specified in advance,\nDesigners would place Components in the site model then adjust and integrate\nthem into their local conditions.  Figure \\ref{img:ccanoodleslinkers}\nillustrates a group of Noodles interacting with one another and elements of the\nsite model.  Linkers are deployed to cross connect Noodles where opportunities\nexist.  Independent Components change shape and configuration -- what the\narchitects termed <code>formal mutations' -- as a result of these interactions. The aggregate configuration of these components was the design. Designers could change the</code>mixture' of Components to achieve different design objectives.</p>\n<p>\\index{Scenario}\nScenarios guided the interactions of Components, and the development of\ndesigns.  The concept of scenario as employed in the IFCCA project is related\nto the concept of \\textit{version}.  However, where a version simply makes the\ndistinction that some artifact is different from and related to another\nartifact, scenarios capture the contingent relation between the context of\ndesign and the artifacts that arise in response.  In so far as they are\n\\textit{interpretations} of a context as it exists, or speculations about how a\ncontext may develop in the future, scenarios can be said to bind the subjective\nstate of the Designer with the resultant design.  Scenarios organize design\nactivity into focused explorations, often centered around design narratives and\nkey factors.  Narratives are heuristic devices employed by Designers to guide\nthe development of design activity over time.  For example, a Designer may\ndevise a scenario around the notion of `growth' of an element over time.  The\ndesign that follows would then employ this notion to guide design work, and\nemphasize those characteristics that make growth behavior apparent in the\ndesign. Factors are properties that give a scenario \\textit{identity}.</p>\n<p>\\begin{figure}[h]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=5in,height=4.35in]{files/introduction/MAYNE1999-NOODLES-LINKERS.png}\n\\caption{Noodles and Linkers.

The design team decided early on\nto situate the park on an elevated plinth.  Subsequently, each design scenario\ntook the plinth as its starting point.  Three major design scenarios,\nidentified as scenarios 33, 15 and 28, were developed.  Each scenario explored\ndesign possibilities based on different levels of investment in building cost,\nfloor area ratio, total daytime population, and total floor area for the\ndevelopment.  Scenario 28 (Figure \\ref{img:scenario28}) had the highest total\nfloor area, followed by 15 (Figure \\ref{img:scenario15}) and then 33\n(Figure \\ref{img:scenario33}).  In scenarios 28 and 15, a large cluster of\nNoodles occupy the south edge of the site adjacent to the Chelsea district.\nThe existing Madison Square Gardens building is replaced with a high density\ntower Component called a Conquistador, and then a new sports facility is\ndesigned in a site further west.  The waterfront in both of these scenarios\nis occupied by recreational buildings and artificial beaches.  Scenario 33,\nincreases the open park area over scenarios 15 and 28, and the high density\ncluster of Noodle components is moved farther East.</p>\n<p>\\index{form-Z}\n\\index{Maya}\nYu recalls that one of the original motivations for taking on the project was\nto experiment with new parametric modeling software.  At the time,\nAlias/Wavefront had just released the first version of Maya, which offered a\nscriptable modeling environment that could potentially be used to prototype a\nparametric approach.  However, as Yu explains, learning to use Maya while\nexecuting the project proved to be too difficult.  The early conceptual work of\nthe project was initiated in physical models.  Following initial physical\nstudies, the remaining design work was produced using form-Z.  Given that form-Z\nhad no scripting support, the team could only suggest through imagery their\ndesign intent.  As such, they produced a series of Flash animations that were\nused to communicate the idea of parametric exploration by showing the\ntransformation of the designs based on changes to the four primary factors.</p>\n<p>\\begin{table}[hp]\n\\centering\n\\begin{tabular}{|p{1in}|p{2.4in}|p{2.4in}|}\n\\hline\nIndependent Component&#x26;Morphological Traits&#x26;Programmatic Affinities\\\n\\hline\nM1.

Independent Components were morphological\ntypes defined through geometric properties and relations.  Components then\ninteracted with other Components in the site, leading to formal mutations and an\nincreasing specificity of the Components to their local conditions.  Interactions\nbetween Components were guided and organized into scenarios that could be\npresented as contingent designs.  This approach supported change and\nresponsiveness to the conditions of the site in a number of ways.</p>\n<p>\\index{Independent Component}\nIndependent Components were systemic objects with geometric organization and\nidentity. Noodles for example, were proportionately long and slender.  When a\nDesigner modified an instance of a Noodle, they would stretch and bend it in\nthe CAD model, understanding that it should remain identifiable as a long and\nslender object.  Second, rules or behaviors associated with the Component\nguided and localized its interactions with other Components.  For example,\ngiven that Components were intended as building-like objects, in most\ncircumstances they would need to maintain minimum clearances from one another\nto ensure proper access to light and air.  As such, placing a Component next to\nanother Component would effectively trigger the <code>setback' rule, and prompt the Designer to modify the Component and adjacent Components to resolve the condition. As Independent Components</code>interacted' with one another, their\nforms became more specific to their local circumstances.  The local focus of\ninteractions meant that Components could be added and removed from the model\nwithout necessitating redesigns of the whole.  Third, notions of agency\ncoupled with the Components guided their deployment and interactions in the\nmodel.  When situated in a particular condition, a Component might seek\nto improve its state, or respond to changes in the context in some particular\nfashion.  The role of the Designer was to execute those responses in light of\nthe identity of the Component.</p>\n<p>\\index{Scenario}\nScenarios complemented the exploratory facilities provided by Components by\nconstraining and focusing design activity, providing guiding narratives,\nbreaking the design process into chunks, and enabling reflection.  Yu explains\nthat there were four principal factors underpinning the three design scenarios\n--- levels of investment in building cost, floor area ratio, total daytime\npopulation, and total floor area for the whole development.  The multi-scenario\napproach organized the exploration of variations on these four specific\nfactors.  Particular themes emerged in these scenario explorations: low,\nmedium and high density variations, alternative locations of Madison Square\nGardens, waterfront recreational facilities, and so on.  We might characterize\nthis emergence of themes as an effective <code>clustering' of design variations or factor values. Scenario designs and their corresponding design themes evolved over time. This evolution could be conceived of in terms of a continuous process or an incremental movement (ie. in</code>steps') between different\nconceptualizations.  Regardless, the scenario provides a discrete unit of\nconceptualization or design that can be extended and developed further.  The\nmulti-scenario approach is also an overt \\textit{exploratory} strategy that\naffords increased opportunities for comparison between designs, reflection and\nlearning.  By representing scenarios in different states and at different\ntimes, the Designer is provided opportunities to learn by considering the\nnature of the differences presented, and making connections between Designer\nactions and results.</p>\n<p>\\index{Independent Component}\n\\index{Scenario}\nThe design approach distinguished different strata or areas of concern\nwithin the overall process and within the design itself.  The development of\nIndependent Components, for example, was a different concern and a different\nprocess than the management of interactions between Components and the site, or\nthe development and evaluation of scenarios.  Such a separation of concerns\nwould not preclude integrated development of these different areas but,\nafforded the opportunity to reduce the interdependencies between activities such\nthat they could be executed asynchronously.  Such a separation of concerns also\nallowed Designers to focus on more narrow tasks without having to worry about\ntheir immediate interrelation with the larger process or design.</p>\n<p>\\index{Identity}\n\\index{Independent Component}\nFinally, taken as a whole, the approach facilitated change and adaptation\nthrough its focus on process rather than on the product of design activity. In\nproviding Independent Components with identity and rules governing their\ninteractions with other Components, Designers would not have to rethink their\nindividual forms when changes occurred.  By organizing designs around the basis\nof interactions, the design could be continually changed and modified without\nhaving to think about the design compositionally.  By making explicit the\nprocess for executing interactions, the design could be realized faster and\nchanges made with less effort.</p>\n<p>\\subsection{Analysis}</p>\n<p>The Morphosis/Yu IFCCA project is multi-faceted, and responds to concerns\nlocated both within the competition and within the discipline of architecture\nitself. In attempting to understand and describe what we find most compelling\nabout the work, we have approached it from various perspectives and sought to\nsituate our discussion and analysis in appropriate theoretical grounds.  Our\nreadings have led us to three research domains that we contend are relevant to\nthe work at hand: systems, Designer cognitive behavior, and parametric\nmodeling.  We have argued that the IFCCA approach renders the design as a\nsystem of interacting parts.  The systems sciences provide us with a general\nmodel of systems and their properties, and specify heuristic methods that\nenable their study.  The systems approach to organizational management\nsuggests strategies for improving the performance and adaptability of systems.<br>\nThe cognitive sciences provide empirical evidence of the limitations of human\ncognitive faculties.  Designer cognitive behaviors develop from those\nlimitations and, in response, Designers have developed characteristic\nstrategies for reducing cognitive complexity when dealing with design problems.<br>\nThe IFCCA approach employs hierarchy and discrete choice throughout the design\nprocess, affording means for reducing the cognitive complexity of design tasks.<br>\nFinally, parametric CAD systems enable the modeling of both objects and\nrelations; in other words, systems.  There is a natural affinity between the\nIFCCA approach, which we argue renders the design as a system of interacting\nparts, and parametric tools that facilitate the modeling of systems.</p>\n<p>In the following sections, we provide high level overviews of each of these\nresearch domains, characterize the properties of the IFCCA approach through\nthe lens of each of these domains, and then draw from those analyses key\nthemes and principles to guide the development of our proposed parametric\nmodeler.  Our analysis will also serve to locate opportunities for further\nresearch.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 17, 2007","path":"/20070417-ifcca-competition-for-the-design-of-cities","title":"IFCCA Competition for the Design of Cities"}}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}

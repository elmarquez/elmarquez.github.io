Second, the context of design and the objects of\ndesign themselves are more complex now than ever before.  While\nindustrialization has significantly expanded our capacity to produce the same\nor similar objects millions of times over and with ever increasing economy, it\nhas not led to a similar increase in our ability to address the complex\nconditions of our contemporary world.  Complexity challenges designers to be\ncognizant of both the interrelatedness and particularity of phenomena that\ncharacterize design problems.

In Chapter 1, we describe the\nMorphosis/Yu project and the properties that make it relevant for\nour research.  We situate our observations in the domains of General Systems\nTheory, organizational management, Cognitivist research in designer behavior,\nparametric modeling, and a class of design support systems known as Design\nSpace Explorers.  We outline major concepts found in each of these research\nareas and discuss their relevance to the issues at hand.  In Chapter 2, we\nrecast the Morphosis/Yu project as an exemplary research problem in\nparametric modeling and describe particular objectives for research in this\narea.  We propose a novel propagation-based, parametric modeling application\nintended to facilitate change and development in design.  The proposed\napplication is organized around the interactions of three computational\nentities: Assembly, Behavior and Scenario.  Underpinning these entities is a\nparallel computing architecture known as the Systolic Array.  We describe how\nBehaviors manage interactions and facilitate change in the model over time\nthrough an implicit relational modeling approach that takes the form of the\nDynamic Proxy pattern.  Chapter 3 provides a detailed description of our\nimplemented system.  We outline in detail the high level organization,\nparticular concepts and interactions that characterize the system.  We describe\nour user interface studies and vectors of inquiry, both past and ongoing, in\nthe development of the application.  Having developed a demonstrable system, we\npresented the system to experts in the domain of architectural design and\nparametric modeling.
